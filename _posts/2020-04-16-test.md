Within **뭔개소리지~~** the Hôtel de Crillon, which was built in 1758, Les Ambassadeurs operated as a restaurant since the mid-ㄹㄴㅇㄹㄴㄹㄴㄹ aristocracy, in the 1870s it also became a regular destination of some of the best known figures of art and the demi-monde. Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec portrayed visitors at the night club, and Aristide Bruant performed there.

Following a renovation of the hotel in 1981–85, the restaurant occupied a former private ballroom with windows looking out taurant, L'Écrin, within the renovated hotel; the former space of Les Ambassadeurs became a bar.
